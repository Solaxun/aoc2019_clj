  "Randomly select neighbors to move to, with decreasing frequency as
  temperature drops. Temperature should  decrease over time, and as that
  happens the resultant value of e^-delta/t will approach zero.

  Finally, once the value of e^-delta/temp is determined, it is compared
  to a uniformly random number between 0 and 1.  If the value exceeds this
  random number, we switch.

  Example of how temperature impacts probability of switching, holding delta
  constant:

    exp(-0.01) ~= 0.99  - almost certainly switch (likely > random(0,1)
    exp(-0.99) ~= 0.37  - likely not switch (likely < rand(0,1)

  One useful heuristic for setting an initial temperature is to estimate
  the maximum absolute delta of the cost-fn.  In this implementation, that
  temperature is represented by the constant 'k' to the schedule function.
